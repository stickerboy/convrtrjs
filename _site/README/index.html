<h1>Convrtr</h1>
<p>For everlost and Grollow!</p>
<p>Convrtr is a simple JavaScript based tool to quickly convert text between different formats. Started out life as a series of small PHP based scripts to help solve ARG related data-driven puzzles, which eventually made its way to a microsite for working on the go. I decided to migrate to JavaScript so I could host on Github and not need a dedicated host, easier to run offline as well.</p>
<p>The microsite idea was born from an online decoding tool that shut down, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130208054819/everlost.nl/convert.php">Everlost</a>. I built Convrtr using a similar layout, with early Bootstrap styling as a theme - which has been upgraded over time.</p>
<p>Today it's powered by <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy">11ty</a> and <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">Bootstrap 5.3</a>.</p>
