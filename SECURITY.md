We take security seriously at Convrtr and appreciate your help in keeping our project safe and trustworthy. If you discover a vulnerability or have concerns about the security of the project, please follow the steps below to report it responsibly.

## Reporting Security Issues

- **Found a security bug?** Thank you for looking out for us!
- **Please don’t open a public issue.** Instead, submit an issue to our [security tracker](https://github.com/stickerboy/convrtrjs/security/advisories/new).
- Alternatively, you can email us privately at [security@convrtr.xyz]
- Include as much detail as you can — what you found, how to reproduce it, and why it’s a concern.
- We’ll review it quickly and get back to you as soon as possible.
- Responsible disclosure is appreciated — we’ll credit you if you'd like (or keep it anonymous).

Thanks for helping keep Convrtr safe and secure!

- Any potential impact or risk associated with the vulnerability.
- Your contact information (optional, if you'd like credit or follow-up).

## Our Commitment

We aim to respond to security reports as soon as possible and will work with you to understand and resolve the issue promptly. Once resolved, we may publish a security advisory and acknowledge your contribution if desired.

## Scope
