                A collection of custom decoding tools for encrypting and decrypting data, built primarily for use in data-drive ARG puzzles (specifically the <a href="https://www.halopedia.org/Section_3_ARG" class="text-convrtr">Halo 4 Section 3 ARG</a>). 
                These tools are a JavaScript port or a Toolkit originally written in ruby, which can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Sepheus/ONI-Tools/tree/master/Toolkit" class="text-convrtr">https://github.com/Sepheus/ONI-Tools/tree/master/Toolkit</a>

                <strong>This section is still a work in progress</strong>, and tools are currently only available via the web console until a UI can be built for them. Most require specifically crafted data packets that were built for the ARG, there may still be some floating around out in space somewhere!

            <p class="px-2 m-0">
                Please note that these tools aren't optimized for large amounts of data, processing can slow down or run into problems once you reach above <code class="d-inline-flex px-2 bg-success bg-opacity-10 border border-success border-opacity-10 rounded-2">150,000</code> characters. A cap of 1 million characters is currently in place.
