## New features
-  Reversing hex nibbles is now exposed in the UI, you can change reversal types using a toggle. 
An updated description of what each reversal does has been added to the component: Unlike reversing the entire string where `48 65 6c 6c 6f` [Hello] becomes `f6 c6 c6 56 84`, this reverses each individual hex byte in the same order. `48 65 6c 6c 6f` becomes `84 56 c6 c6 f6`. The Reverse Nibbles toggle reverses the order of each hex byte in the string, so `48 65 6c 6c 6f` becomes `6f 6c 6c 65 48`

## Changes
- Button styles for most buttons have been updated to use the full block color, rather than outline, for better visibility
