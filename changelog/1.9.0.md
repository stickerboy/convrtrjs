## New features
- Decoder chaining!
This is essentially a copy/paste time saver. Enabling the "Chain decoders" toggle changes the target container of each decoder button to be the Text decoder textarea, rather than its own closest textarea. So if you, for example, have a string of text that's been encoded as: Text -> Hex -> Base64  - you would paste the Base64 into the Text textarea, activate the chain toggle, then press the relevant decode button to quickly solve the puzzle.
