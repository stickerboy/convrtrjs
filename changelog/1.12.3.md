## New features
- Keyed Ceasar cipher #13 
Added the ability to pass a key into the Caesar cipher, creating a custom alphabet that can be rotated through

## Changes
- Added multi-case support to Substitution cipher
Where previously all results were displayed in lowercase, regardless of case entered, case is now respected in both the given string and the key. This means that results will differ now when passing data through.
- Added ability to pass a custom alphabet into the `rot()` function
