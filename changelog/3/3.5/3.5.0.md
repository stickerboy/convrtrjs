## New features
### Exif Reader
 - Added a nw tool that reads and displays Exif data / metadata from various types of image files.

[![Exif reader tool showing exif data from an image file]({{ '/assets/img/changelog/exif.png' | url }})]({{ '/assets/img/changelog/exif.png' | url }})

## Improvements
### Changelogs
 - Added next/previous and earliest/latest pagination links to Changelog items, making it easier to scroll through the history or the site.

## Bug fixes
### Platform
- Fixed an issue with code copying across all tools, where the results are would be converted to plain text and strip out any formatting.
