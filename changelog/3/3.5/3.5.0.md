## New features
### [Exif Reader](/files/exif)
 - Added a new tool that reads and displays Exif data / metadata from various types of image files.

[![Exif reader tool showing exif data from an image file]({{ '/assets/img/changelog/exif.png' | url }})]({{ '/assets/img/changelog/exif.png' | url }})

## Improvements
### Changelogs
 - Added next/previous and earliest/latest pagination links to Changelog items, making it easier to scroll through the history or the site.

## Bug fixes
### Platform
- Fixed an issue with code copying across all tools&mdash;where the results are displayed, the contents would be converted to plain text and stripped of any HTML formatting.
