## New features
### Settings
 - Added a new page for user settings. Currently it only displays show/hide options for tools, but I'm hopeful I can open it up to other things in the future—like also bringing over site theme and data clearing (while they are in the header, it could be useful to have them here too).
 
 ## Behind the scenes improvements
<details>
<summary>This is a list of more technical and non-front-facing improvements made to the site</summary>

### Improvements
- added additional flag to nav.json to allow excluding any non-tool items. Easiest way to get all the metadata I want/need
- Refactored Bootstrap theme settings to use my own local storage functions, for consistency
- Refactored fileExists filter to take an optional path
- Removed unused liquid filters
