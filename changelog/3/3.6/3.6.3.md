## Improvements
### Search 
- Query string parameters: you can now pass a query string to the search page and it will generate results. Interacting with the search box on the search page will automatically update the URL without refreshing the page. Exposing a quick search in the site header is in the backlog for a future update
- Exposed page tags in search results and added badge styling for changelogs tags
- Added some additional 'ignore' attributes to various content areas, to tighten up search results

## Bug fixes
- Added missing background transitions to search filters and results
- Fixed incorrect page title on the Vigenère cipher page
