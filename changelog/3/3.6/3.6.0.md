## New features
### [Pigpen cipher](/misc/pigpen)
The Pigpen cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter is represented by a symbol formed from parts of a grid. These symbols use straight or angled lines, and may include a dot to distinguish characters.

[![Example pigpen cipher text]({{ '/assets/img/changelog/pigpen.png' | url }})]({{ '/assets/img/changelog/pigpen.png' | url }})

## Improvements
- Increase font size on results that include image generation

## Bug fixes
- Fixed issues with multi-line image generation  
  If a tool includes image generation, and the text wrapped to more than 1 line, it wouldn't wrap in the image. Instead it would get cut off as it tried to render outside the allowed area. Canvas is still beyond me, so after a lot of digging and searching, I ultimately used CoPilot to assist in  generating this fix.
- Fixed missing "Previous" version title on changelogs
