## New features
### Site search
- Implemented [PageFind](https://pagefind.app/) for site searching. Search results are automatically highlighted and a number of filters are available to quickly narrow down search results. A new link/icon for search is available in the header.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed an issue where I accidentally forgot to make the Discord and GitHub links the mobile header view... links...ðŸ«£
- Fixed an issue where page backgrounds in dark mode may show a block of white in some instances, if the content doesn't stretch all the way down
- Fixed image scaling in changelogs
- Fixed content being shifted when tabbing into the skip-to-content link

## Behind the scenes changes
<details>
<summary>This is a list of more technical and non-front-facing changes made to the site</summary>

### Changes
- Updated the structure of changelog files to add an additional sub-folder based on minor version. Keeping it a little tidier and easier to manage/search through
- Added pagination details to changelog pages in site title and page title, this helps differentiate pages in search results
- Added "Changelog | " prefix to changelog items - this shows in search results, but is hidden on each changelog page
- Made some adjustments to the sitemap to allow setting the change frequence of pages like search, privacy, accessibility and changelog items to "never" as they are unlikely to change very often (if at all)
- Updated page title separator to a pipe for consistency
- Swapped out left/right arrow for its HTML named entity
