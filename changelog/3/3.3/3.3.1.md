## Changes
### Sidebar / Navigation
- Added tooltips to the sidebar navigation when the sidebar is closed, making it easier to see what a section is without opening the menu. 
- Tooltips are disabled when the menu is opened, then re-enabled on close
- Sidebar tabs/buttons have slightly increased in size to allow a better tap target and for better support of triggering the tooltip

## Bug fixes
- Fixed casing of GitHub across the platform
