## Changes
- Reworked functionality to convert strings to hex, allowing any valid hex characters to be converted
- Reworked functionality of hex shifter in the same manner, also surfacing an error message now on invalid hex
- Updated some regex matches to potentially be a bit more performant (dropping the reliance on the case-insensitive flag)
- Switch to locale case when doing transforms with casing

## Bug fixes
- Shift hex now correctly handles the delimiter dropdown when converting
