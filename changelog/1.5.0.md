As more tools and changes are being added, the front page is getting cluttered, so this is an overhaul to try and fix some of that.

## New features
- Split tools up into 3 pages: home, hex and ciphers
- Home is currently for convrtrs and text tools, hex is for hex specific tools and ciphers for all the ciphers (pretty straightforward)

## Changes
- Max width now set for main content area, won't go above 1920px
- Grids have been updated and improved to better handle columns on larger screen sizes
- Updated data clearing to also clear results areas and 'key' textboxes
- Added 'Large data warning' to all available tools

## Bug fixes
- Only show a success message if there was data to clear
