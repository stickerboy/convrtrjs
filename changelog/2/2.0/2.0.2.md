## Changes
- Re-introduced the 'release' tag to all relevant changelogs
- Only show "View on GitHub" release link on a changelog, if that version was officially released
- Updated release badge color and description
- Added remainder of the changelog items from GitHub, right back to 1.0.1
- Increased the spacing between changelog content and the "View on GitHub" button

## Bug fixes
- Fixed missing 'v' prefix on the title of Changelog pages (Using `templateSyntax` is a weird but decent enough workaround to only target the changelog item itself)
  
  ## Behind the scenes changes

<summary>This is a list of more technical and non-front-facing changes made to the site</summary>

### Bug fixes
- Correctly handle navigation urls by adding the `|` url filter. Main nav urls were broken due to `../`, when in a sub-directory, not pointing to the root of the site
