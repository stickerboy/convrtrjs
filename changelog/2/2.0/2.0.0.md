### [Changelog](/changelog)
- Added a built in changelog that shows recent feature additions, updates, and bug fixes (saves going offsite to GitHub)  
- Accessible from the fly-out navigation and by clicking the site version number in the footer
- Tags are also clickable, leading to a filtered list of changelog items that include the given tag/label
- Added a list of available tags, along with the number of times that tag has been used and a link to the filtered changelog list (if greater than 0)

### Hex reversing
- Added correct functionality for reversing Hex nibbles
- Added ability to chain reverse commands together
- Added delimiter support to all reverse functions
