## New features
### Changelog
- Added a built in changelog that shows recent feature additions, updates, and bug fixes (saves going offsite to Github)  
Accessible from the fly-out navigation and by clicking the site version number in the footer
- Tags are also clickable, leading to a filtered list of changelog items that include the given tag/label
- Added a list of available tags, along with the number of times that tag has been used and a link to the filtered changelog list (if greater than 0)
### Hex reversing
- Added correct functionality for reversing Hex nibbles
- Added ability to chain reverse commands together
- Added delimiter support to all reverse functions
### Breadcrumbs
- Added breadcrumb navigation across the site, for additional ease of navigation

## Changes
### Platform
- Migrated the codebase to ESM to (hopefully) make it easier to maintain and improve going forward
- Split front-end JS functionality into its own file, separate from main functions
- Assigned some functions [ONI] to the global window object, so they can still be accessed from the web console
- Updated/improved various JS Doc comments
- Added meta keywords and open graph tags to the site
### Frontend
- Improved/unified various tool descriptions and examples
- Added changelog and sitemap links to the flyout navigation
- Changed the version number link in the footer to point to the internal changelog now, rather than Github
- Changed the "Not data to clear" notice to be informational, rather than a warning (no data isn't always bad)
### A11y
- Remove italicised fonts and replaced with prefixed dash
- Improved labels/titles on Forerunner buttons
- Improved the color contrast ratios with links, buttons, and labels

## Bug fixes
- Fixed issue with binary conversion, ensuring that spaces are not counted when checking if Binary is valid
- Correctly handle times when local storage won't have a stored value for a section toggle
- [A11y] Fixed incorrect hex delimiter label on Convrtrs
