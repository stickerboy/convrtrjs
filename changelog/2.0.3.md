## Changes
- Reversed the sorting of changelog tags list, so that the latest published version for that tag shows at the top
- Added a true/false "visible" flag to all tags that will prevent them from appearing in the tags list (though they'll still be accessible directly, and if they are added to a changelog). Some tags are really for Github only, but want to sync them here and keep them in case they're ever needed
