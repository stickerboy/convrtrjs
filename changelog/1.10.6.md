## New features
- Added ability to reverse hex nibbles, different from functionality that was there already, and wording updated to reflect. This functionality is not yet exposed in the UI, will be in a future update.
- Added validation function for hex string
- Added validation function for binary string
- Added ability to use "No delimiter" in a hex conversion, so you can drop in a string with just hex characters and correctly convert to and from

## Changes
- Improved performance of morsernary by moving to a single match, rather than chaining
- Improved and simplified the reveseHex function
- Improved error handling across functions
- Moved delimiter dropdown to a liquid partial, so that it can be reused across the site

## Bug fixes
- Correctly pass values from the delimiter dropdown through to all the functions that require it
