## New features
### Sidebar / Navigation
Technically a change, but also a new feature so highlighting it here
- Overhauled the primary navigation across the site, replacing the bootstrap offcanvas flyout menu with a left hand expanding sidebar
- Sidebar can be expanded by clicking on the hamburger icon next to the sitename, or by cliking on a menu tab
- Clicking a tab will auto-expand to reveal a list of all the child pages
- Closing the menu will close all open tabs
- Added new icons for each of the primary sections (these will be improved upon in future)
- Re-arranged order of items in the menu

### Pagingation
- Added "Jump to first page" and "Jump to last page" pagination links

## Changes
- Moved the footer inside the main content area
- Minor improvement to the 404 message text
- Moved pagination into its own separate component file, so it can be re-used elsewhere
- Reduced the previous page number count down to 1, so there's more space and hopefully helps prevent pagination from breaking out of page boundaries
- On mobile, hide the Next/Previous text in favor of simple ASCII arrows ⇦ `&#8678;` and ⇨ `&#8680;`
- Updated Bootstrap core js to 5.3.3

## Bug fixes
- Fixed some sass compiler warnings
