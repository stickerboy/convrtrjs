## New features
### Pagingation
- Added "Jump to first page" and "Jump to last page" pagination links

## Changes
- Moved pagination into its own separate component file, so it can be re-used elsewhere
- Reduced the previous page number count down to 1, so there's more space and hopefully helps prevent pagination from breaking out of page boundaries
- On mobile, hide the Next/Previous text in favor of simple ASCII arrows ⇦ `&#8678;` and ⇨ `&#8680;`

## Bug fixes
