## New features
### Individual tool pages
Each tool, along with remaining available on each main/top-level page, is also now available on their own dedicated page. 

### Sidebar / Navigation
- Overhauled the primary navigation across the site, replacing the bootstrap offcanvas flyout menu with a left hand expanding sidebar (though a customised offcanvas version of the menu exists for smaller screen devices)
- Sidebar can be expanded by clicking on the hamburger icon next to the sitename
- Clicking the dropdown toggle on a tab will auto-expand to reveal a list of all the child pages
- Child pages now link through to that tool's dedicated page, instead of scrolling to its position (goodbye scroll issues)
- Closing the menu will close all open tabs
- Added new icons for each of the primary sections (these will be improved upon in future)
- Re-arranged order of items in the menu

### Pagingation
- Added "Jump to first page" and "Jump to last page" pagination links

## Changes
- Moved the footer inside the main content area
- Minor improvement to the 404 message text
- Reduced the previous page number count down to 1, so there's more space and hopefully helps prevent pagination from breaking out of page boundaries
- On mobile, hide the Next/Previous text in favor of simple ASCII arrows ⇦ `&#8678;` and ⇨ `&#8680;`
- Removed scrolling from the root HTML element and focused it on the <main> content area
- Switched Sitemap to a masonary layout, to neaten it up a little
- Add page links to sitemap headers

## Bug fixes
- Fixed issue with tag filter where it had the potential to expose other site assets/pages
- Fixed some issues with keyword encode/decode, where the custom generated alphabet wouldn't always be reliable and provide inaccurate results
- Fixed some sass compiler warnings

## Behind the scenes changes
<details>
<summary>This is a list of more technical and non-front facing changes made to the site  </summary>

#### New features
- Added dynamic(-ish) import for JS files on all Pages, this way when the pages are included in the main landing page, they'll all come with the necessary functionality

#### Changes
- Moved pagination into its own separate component file, so it can be re-used elsewhere
- Updated Bootstrap core js to 5.3.3
- Created individual mjs files for each tool event and functions
- Reduced the number of scripts loaded on a each page, additionally only loading in the scripts and functions necessary for that tool
- Updated all scripts to output functions to the window object, making them web console accessible/usable
