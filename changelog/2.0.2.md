## Changes
- Re-introduced the 'release' tag to all relevant changelogs
- Only show "View on Github" release link on a changelog, if that version was officially released
- Updated release badge color and description
- Added remainder of the changelog items from Github, right back to 1.0.1

## Bug fixes
- Correctly handle navigation urls by adding the | url filter. Main nav urls were broken due to `../`, when in a sub-directory, not pointing to the root of the site
- Fixed missing 'v' prefix on the title of Changelog pages  
  Using `templateSyntax` is a weird but decent enough workaround to only target the changelog item itself
