## New features
- File type checker
Select a file and it will return the first few bytes of it, allowing potential detection of the file type. Useful if a file extension has been changed and you want to check what it used to be. A hex and visual representation of the file are returned in the results, whether there is a match or not. Convrtr only checks a small set of file headers, the most common ones that you me come across.

- File headers table
A table of common files and the first few bytes of their header in hexadecimal format, for quick reference.
