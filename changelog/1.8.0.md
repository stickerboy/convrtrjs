## New features
- Dark mode and Theme switcher 
  - Used the JS theme switcher provided on the Bootstrap website and more or less the same dropdown layout.
  - Made one change to switch to CSS classes for the icons instead of SVGs
  - Swapped out a lot of color specific CSS classes on elements, for CSS that targets dark mode (where appropriate)
