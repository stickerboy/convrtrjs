## New features
### Color generator
- Generates hex colors from a given string of data, displayed as both a list of hex colors and visually as blocks of colors. Padding is used to add extra characters, in the event the hex colors can't make up to 6 characters. You can hover over each block to get the hex color of the block, or copy/download all the colors.
