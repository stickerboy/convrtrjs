## New features
- Header menu re-design
As the header was getting a little cluttered with all the new sections, it has now been moved to a flyout/offcanvas menu. Click the hamburger menu icon in the top left to access it. The 4 buttons for discord, Github, clear data and theme are now always present regardless of screen size. Discord and Github are also present in the offcanvas menu. Scrolling the page is still enabled while the menu is open.
- Made some styling adjustments to support dark mode
