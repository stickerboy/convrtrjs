## New features
- Added ability to reverse hex nibbles, different from functionality that was there already, and wording updated to reflect. This functionality is not yet exposed in the UI, will be in a future update
- Added ability to use "No delimiter" in a hex conversion, so you can drop in a string with just hex characters and correctly convert to and from
