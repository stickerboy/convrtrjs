## New features
- Added a Sitemap page: an easy-to-read overview of all sections on the site

## Changes
- Made internal changes to automatically include new sections on each page, including any necessary JS assets. As a result, the sort order for all nav items (both in the nav and on each page) has changed to alphabetical
- Increased font size for sidebar/nav headings and spaced out sub-links a little more

## Bug fixes
- Fixed an issue where data could not be cleared on the ONI tools page
- Increased padding on the 'back to top' button to pass size requirements
- Fixed background color on bg-convrtr that is used for toast success messages
