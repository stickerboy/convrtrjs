## Behind the scenes changes
<details>
<summary>This is a list of more technical and non-front-facing changes made to the site</summary>

### Improvements
#### Platform
These are primarily internal changes, relating to how the site is built
- Added a new shortcode to pass the name of a file when including a partial
- Added a new filter to uppercase the first letter of a string
- Used &#123;&#123; filename &#125;&#125; to automatically set values in partials, rather than typing everything out. Still need to handle JS manually, but this makes some things easier.
- Renamed a few files to prevent conflicts and follow the same format for all partials
- Replaced variable declaration for delimiter with filename
