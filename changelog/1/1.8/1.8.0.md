## New features
### Dark mode and Theme switcher 
- Used the JS theme switcher provided on the Bootstrap website and more or less the same dropdown layout
- Made one change to switch to CSS classes for the icons instead of SVGs
- Swapped out a lot of color specific CSS classes on elements, for CSS that targets dark mode (where appropriate)

## Improvements
- Changed the clear data icon to recycle, works a little better on a button without borders
