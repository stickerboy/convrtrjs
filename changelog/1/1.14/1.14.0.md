## New features
- "Kill the demon! The Covenant demands it!"
Added a glyph conversion for Halo Covenant symbols, under Miscellaneous. Click the symbols to create words and phrases, with the Forerunner symbols also present below. Click the "Create image" button to download an image of the selected Covenant glyphs. The toggle changes the image between a transparent and white background.
