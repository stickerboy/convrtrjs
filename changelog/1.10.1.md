## Bug fixes
- Fix theme handling for OS preference (from Bootstrap 5.3.3):
> Fixed our color-modes.js script to handle the case where the OS is set to light mode and the auto color mode is used on the website. If you copied the script from our docs, you should apply this change to your own script.
