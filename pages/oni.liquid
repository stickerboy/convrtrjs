title: ONI tools
description: >
  A collection of custom decoding tools for encrypting and decrypting data, built primarily for use in
  data-drive ARG puzzles (specifically the <a href="https://www.halopedia.org/Section_3_ARG" class="text-convrtr">Halo 4
  Section 3 ARG</a>). These tools are a JavaScript port or a Toolkit originally written in ruby, which can be found
  here - <a href="https://github.com/Sepheus/ONI-Tools/tree/master/Toolkit"
  class="text-convrtr">https://github.com/Sepheus/ONI-Tools/tree/master/Toolkit</a>.
  <p class="px-2"><strong>This section is still a work in progress</strong>, and tools are currently only available via
  the web console until a UI can be built for them. Most require specifically crafted data packets that were built for
  the ARG, there may still be some floating around out in space somewhere!</p>
