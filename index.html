                            Convrtr is a simple JavaScript based tool to quickly convert text between different formats. A description of each decoder and link to more information is available using the info button in the top-right of each decoder. You can also copy the contents on individual decoders and download the contents to a text file.

                            Please note that these tools aren't optimized for large amounts of data, processing can slow down or run into problems once you reach above <code class="d-inline-flex px-2 text-dark bg-success bg-opacity-10 border border-success border-opacity-10 rounded-2">150,000</code> characters. A cap of 1 million characters is currently in place.
