# Convrtr
For everlost and Grollow!

Convrtr is a simple JavaScript based tool to quickly convert text between different formats. Started out life as a series of small PHP based scripts to help solve ARG related data-driven puzzles, which eventually made its way to a microsite for working on the go. I decided to migrate to JavaScript so I could host on GitHub and not need a dedicated host, easier to run offline as well.

The microsite idea was born from an online decoding tool that shut down, called [Everlost](https://web.archive.org/web/20130208054819/everlost.nl/convert.php). I built Convrtr using a similar layout, with early Bootstrap styling as a theme - which has been upgraded over time.

Today it's powered by [11ty](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) and [Bootstrap 5.3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).
