We care about your privacy and want to be transparent about how your data is handled when you use **Convrtr**.

### What We Collect

We do **not** collect or store any personal information on our servers. The only data we collect is through:

- **Google Analytics**: Used to understand how people use the site (e.g., which pages are visited). This data is anonymized and does not include personally identifiable information.

### GDPR Compliance

To comply with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**:

- We have **enabled IP anonymization** in Google Analytics to prevent storing identifiable user data.
- We use **Google Consent Mode**, which respects your cookie preferences and only tracks data if you’ve given consent.
- We provide a **cookie banner** that allows you to opt in or out of analytics tracking.
- We have signed Google’s **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** as required by GDPR.

You can learn more about how Google uses data here.

### What We Store Locally

We use **local storage** in your browser to remember:

- Your **theme preferences** (light or dark mode)
- The **visibility state** of tools (which ones you’ve hidden or shown)

This data stays on your device and is **not shared** with us or any third parties.

#### Local Storage and GDPR

Under GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive, local storage is treated similarly to cookies. However, consent is **not required** when the data stored is:

- **Strictly necessary** for providing a service the user has requested (e.g., remembering tool visibility or theme preferences).

We ensure that local storage is used only for functionality that improves your experience and does not track or profile you.

### Your Choices

- You can **clear your browser’s local storage** at any time to reset your preferences.
- You can **[opt out of Google Analytics tracking](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881)** using browser extensions like Google Analytics Opt-out.
